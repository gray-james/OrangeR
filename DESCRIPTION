Description: A comprehensive ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) toolkit designed to ingest, clean, structure, and validate messy timesheet data from various sources, including unstructured PDFs and structured CSV/Excel files. It intelligently handles common data quality issues like multi-column spillage and inconsistent formats, transforming raw data into an analysis-ready, unified dataset with extensive quality assurance checks.
